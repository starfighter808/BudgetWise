PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMITTING:

When committing to the project, only upload what you are changing

**If you are adding code to an existing file:**

* Navigate to that file in this branch's directory
* Select the file
* Click on the "edit" button in the top right hand corner of GitHub
* Copy/paste your code into the file

**If you are adding an entirely new file:**

* Navigate to the correct folder in this branch's directory
* Click on the "add file" button in the top right hand corner of GitHub
* Upload your file

Following these instructions will help us keep track of what is being changed and by who. 

**How to keep track of changes**

To see what has been changed with each commit, click on the Activity button on the right side of GitHub. There, you can view all commits. If you click on a commit, it will show you all files that have been added/modified. You can click the settings icon (3 dots) beside any file to view which lines of code have been changed.
